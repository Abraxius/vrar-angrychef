# Angry Chef 🍔💥  
A chaotic and comical VR cooking game – developed in Unity for Oculus as a semester project at Hochschule Fulda.

## 🎮 About the Game

In *Angry Chef*, you take on the role of a very impatient burger chef. Your task: prepare randomized burger orders in VR under time pressure, with increasing customer waves and the occasional outburst of culinary rage. Assemble, chop, fry – or just grab your shotgun and skip the order.

Each round is a full day in your virtual burger restaurant. Satisfy your customers to earn money, unlock upgrades, expand your kitchen – and survive the growing madness.

> ⚠️ Warning: May contain meat, shouting customers, and questionable kitchen decisions.

## 🧩 Key Features

- Randomly generated burger orders with unlockable ingredients
- Fully interactive VR gameplay with Oculus (grab, slice, fry, stack… and shoot)
- Upgrade system (new tools, ingredients, tables, prices, ammo…)
- Humorous “Fun Mode” with angry customers in various dialects
- Break room between waves for upgrades and recovery
